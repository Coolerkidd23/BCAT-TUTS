        <h3>Our Story of Evolution and Growth</h3>
        <p class="aboutbcat">
          At BCAT Tuts, we're passionate about empowering students to achieve 
          academic excellence. Our journey began in March 2023, when we founded 
          the organization as a non-profit entity. Our mission was to provide 
          high-quality tutoring services to students in need, regardless 
          of their financial background.
        </p>
        <h3></h3>
        <p class="aboutbcat">
          As we navigated our first year, we realized that our impact could 
          be even greater if we adopted a more sustainable business model. 
          In 2024, we made the strategic decision to evolve into a profit 
          organization. This transition enabled us to expand our services, 
          invest in our tutors' development, and reach even more students.
        </p>
